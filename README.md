# Developing a Functional Chatbot with Recurrent Neural Networks
Artificial Neural Networks, 2019, EPFL

This is the directory of the project for the course "Artifical Neural Netowkrs" Spring 2010, EPFL. The project is organized and demonstrated entirely on Jupyter Notebook.

The purpose of this project is to apply recurrent neural networks to develop a reasonably functional chatbot. The project also demonstrates our ability to process data and develop a deep learning model in Keras.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites

The required environment for running the code and reproducing the results is a computer with a valid installation of Python 3. More specifically, [Python 3.6](https://docs.python.org/3.6/) is used.

Besides that (and the built-in Python libraries), the following packages are used:

* [NumPy 1.15.4](http://www.numpy.org). `pip3 install --user numpy==1.13.3`
* [Matplotlib 3.0.2](https://matplotlib.org). `pip3 install --user matplotlib==2.0.2`
* [Keras 2.2.4](https://pypi.org/project/Keras/)    `pip install --user keras==2.2.4`

## Project Structure

The project has the following folder (and file) structure:

* `data/`. Directory containing original conversation dataset.
* `Notebook`. Contains all code and results.


## How to execute the files.
	
Run each cell within `Notebook` to replicate each result from scratch. Some cells will take a while to finish especially ones which will train the recurrent neural networks. For viewing purposes only, do not execute the notebook.
